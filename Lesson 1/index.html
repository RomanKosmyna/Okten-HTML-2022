    <p><span class="character-span">The Simpsons</span> is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening
        for the Fox
        Broadcasting Company. The series
        is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge,
        Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and
        society, television, and the human condition.</p>
